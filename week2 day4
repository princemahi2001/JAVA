2.Arjun asked to his friend to write a java program to accept a two-digit number.
The Addition of the sum of its digits and the product of its digits.
I the value is equal to the number input, then display the message "special two digit number" otherwise, display the message "not a special two digit number".
If the value is not two digit number than display the message "invalid input"
Sample 1: Line 1 : Enter two digit number: 25 Line 2 : Not a special two digit number
Sample 2: Line 1 : Enter two digit number: 59 Line 2 : Special two digit number
Sample 3: Line 1 : Enter two digit number: 5 Line 2 : Invalid input
Input Format
Enter two digit number
Constraints
9 < n < 100
Output Format
