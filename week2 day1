1.Prof. Decosta has designed multiple sets of the question paper of CSE310: Programming in Java subject. He has assigned a separate character code (A-Z) to each set of question paper but mentioned the paper codes using binary numbers. He needs a program which can accept the binary paper code and convert it in to character code so that he can easily identify the paper code during evaluation. 
If the paper code entered is not having 8 bits (0 or 1) or does not corresponds to A-Z then INVALID PAPER CODE must be printed.
Input Format
First line of input is a Binary Number representing the Paper Code
Constraints
Paper code is a 8 bit binary code
Output Format
Print the Paper Code (Character) and INVALID PAPER CODE if the input is not correct.

2.Consider that two friends Neha and Nisha are going for shopping .Neha has picked the N number of Items from the Market 
and Nisha has picked X number of Items from the Market .Find out total numbers of Items ordered by both .
Input Format
In First input line, you should enter number of Items ordered by Neha. In Second input line, you should enter number of Items ordered by Nisha.
Constraints
Enter only integer (positive) value. 0<=n<=100
Output Format
Total numbers of items ordered by Neha and Nisha during shopping.
