1.Consider that there is a cricket player named Smith who hits certain number of 4s and 6s in a cricket match. 
Find out total numbers of scores he makes with his 4s & 6s only.
Input Format
In First input line, you should enter number of 4s hit by Smith. In Second input line, you should enter number of 6s hit by Smith.
Constraints
Enter only integer (positive) value. 0<=n<=100
Output Format
Total numbers of scores Smith makes with his 4s & 6s only. If any input is given negative, then total scores should be counted as 0.

            System.out.println(total);

2.During the code-based test of Java, Peter has been assigned a task to implement a class which reads the Account Number(Long), 
Account Holder Name(String), Gender (M/F) (Character) and Amount (Integer) to be withdrawn at runtime.
Given that the Current Account Balance is 20000, it is expected to perform the withdrawl 
if amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to 20000 and message to be displayed is:
Hi Mr./Ms. XXX! Your Account Balance after withdrawl is YYYYY.
If the amount to be withdrawn is greater than the Current Account Balance, then the message displayed is:
Hi Mr./Ms. XXX! Insufficient Funds! You can not withdraw AAAAA.
Input Format
First line reads Account Number
Second line reads Account Holder Name
Third line reads Gender
Fourth line reads Amount to be withdrawn
Constraints
Account Number is a 10 digit number
Output Format
**Hi Mr./Ms. XXX!
Your Account Balance after withdrawl is YYYYY.**
